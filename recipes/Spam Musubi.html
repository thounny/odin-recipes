    <h3>Spam Musubi</h3>
    <p>Spam Musubi is a popular snack in Hawaii. It is a type of sushi that has marinated cooked spam in sushi. I got this recipe from a local Hawaiian friend when I was living there.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>2 cups</strong> uncooked short-grain white rice</li>
        <li><strong>2 cups</strong> water</li>
        <li><strong>6 tablespoons</strong> rice vinegar</li>
        <li><strong>1/4 cup</strong> soy sauce</li>
        <li><strong>1/4 cup</strong> oyster sauce</li>
        <li><strong>1/2 cup</strong> white sugar</li>
        <li><strong>1(12 ounce)</strong> container fully cooked luncheon meat (e.g. Spam)</li>
        <li><strong>5 sheets</strong> sushi nori (dry seaweed)</li>
        <li><strong>2 tablespoons</strong> vegetable oil</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Soak uncooked rice for <strong>4 hours</strong>; drain and rinse.</li>
        <li>In a sauce pan bring <strong>2 cups</strong> water to a boil. Add rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for <strong>20 minutes</strong>. Stir in rice vinegar, and set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, stir together soy sauce, oyster sauce, and sugar until sugar is completely dissolved. Slice luncheon meat lengthwise into <strong>10 slices</strong>, or to desired thickness, and marinate in sauce for <strong>5 minutes</strong>.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat oil over medium high heat. Cook slices for <strong>2 minutes</strong> per side, or until lightly browned. Cut nori sheets in half and lay on a flat work surface. Place a rice press in the center of the sheet, and press
            rice tightly inside. Top with a slice of luncheon meat, and remove press. Wrap nori around rice mold, sealing edges with a small amount of water. (Rice may also be formed by hand in the shape of the meat slices, <strong>1 inch thick</strong>.)
            Musubi may be served warm or chilled.</li>

    </ol>
